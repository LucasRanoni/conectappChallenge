This .txt explain how to create a self-signed certificate:

upload the file 'getkey.sh' to a directory, what we created for this.
give it write and read permissions.
convert it to 'dos2unix'.
run it: the file 'provisioningServer.pfx' should appear (it is the key).


move 'key.pfx' to the directory where we have our api.
when we have it we change, the user to the same one that has the api.

add these lines to our 'application.properties':

#SSL
server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
server.ssl.key-store=file:./provisioningServer.pfx
server.ssl.key-store-password=provisioningServer
server.ssl.enabled=true

finally reset the app
